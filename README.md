## Thoughts
There was a time, long before the influx of CS majors and the rise of AI—back when I was still in middle or high school—when I was among very few of my peers who wanted to pursue a career in computer science. Then, around the time I entered college, suddenly everyone else started talking about it. Many people around me who had never shown interest in the field or knew much about it began majoring in CS.

In the many conversations I had with some of them, it seems to me that most aren’t influenced by any particular interest, but are instead following the bandwagon. Now the prospects seem much less appealing. Nowadays, I hear more and more about job cuts, unemployment, and how interviews are becoming increasingly selective. The statistics in the article aren't great for morale either. Demand has decreased while competition has risen. CS is still viable in the west, but it is practically a dead-end career in the East. I can’t say I don’t feel bitter about it.
